PURPOSE OF THIS README

This file gives the infomation about the bug in the original implementation of cannon algorimthm provided in assignment 3

THE BUG CAN BE EXPOSED ON LOCAL PC. NO NEED FOR EXPENSIVE RUNS ON SUPERMUC

1. directory called "bug_exposing_matrices" that has the matrices that our group used to expose the bug
provided in original implenetation of cannon's algorithm
2. directory called "bug_results" that contains the results of runs to expose the bug
3. cannon.c : the faulty code 
4. make file to compile cannon.c source code

HOW TO EXPOSE THE BUG ON LOCAL PC

The input files for cannon algorithm provided in this directory expose the bug in the original implementation
provided along with the 3rd assignment. 

The bug can be exposed by using the bash_script : bug_expose.sh in the parent directory of task3. 

Step 1: on terminal run the command : ./bug_expose.sh

Step 2: in the directory "bug_results" open the file "results.csv" to see the results
