contents of scripts directory: 

1. parser.py : file that parses the results and calculates the mean, variance and standard deviations of various run time results. DO NOT RUN THE PYTHON FILE MANUALLY!!


2. statistics.sh: This bash script calls the parser to parse the results. 
TODO: EDIT statistics.sh  BEFORE RUNNING THE BASH SCRIPT:
    (i) In line 6 : change the variable $TASK to appropriate task (either Task3, Task4 or Task5)
    (ii) In line 7: change the variaboe $PHASE to appropriate Phase of SuperMUC (Phase1 or Phase2)

After doing the above changes, run the script on the command line. The results of parsing will be saved
in the same 'script directory'

3. The parsed results for each combination of SuperMUC phase and tasks. that have been used for final report

3. The required make file
4. directories "phase1" and "phase2" with the final results used for writing the report
